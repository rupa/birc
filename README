An IRC bot written in shell

    birc <channel> <nick> [server [port]]

Takes commands echo'ed into .<nick>/.ctl
    Example: echo "PRIVMSG #channel Hay guys!" >> .ctl

Looks for scripts to run in .<nick>/
    Scripts receive lines in <STDIN>, and $1 is bot's nick
    make scripts executable to enable them, chmod -x to disable them
